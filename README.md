# PZSmashAndGrab
Does stealth bore you? Do you want to smash windows, loot houses, and run away before the undead owners ever find out? This mod is for you! Press 'R' to smash windows, climb sheet ropes, clear glass, and open curtains. Adds the ability to mark items as junk and then use a quick loot button to steal all non-junk items quickly. Also makes looting items provide a very slight amount of experience towards nimbleness. Nimbleness now improves the rate at which you clean glass and quick loot items!
